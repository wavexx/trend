Description: general-purpose, efficient trend graph
 trend is a general-purpose, efficient trend graph for "live" data. Data is
 read in ASCII form from a file or continuously from a FIFO and displayed in
 real-time into a multi-pass trend (much like a CRT oscilloscope). trend can be
 used as a rapid analysis tool for progressive or time-based data series
 together with trivial scripting.
