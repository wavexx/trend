trend 1.1
---------

	* Auto-scaling now considers only the current graph when multiple
	  graphs are present and "hide others" is in effect.
	* 'Legend' is now properly called 'Key'. The 'nN' key bindings were
	  also remapped to 'kK' for consistency.
	* Infinity is now handled like NaNs.
	* DEPRECATES: 'nN' key bindings are still available, but should no
	  longer be used, use 'kK' instead.


trend 1.0
---------

	* Fix man page warnings.
	* Use a traditional version numbering scheme.


Rev #58 03/10/2006 to Rev #68 02/11/2007
----------------------------------------

	* Polling rate limits can now be configured dynamically.
	* Latency sampling now also shows maximal sync times.
	* NaNs can now be entered in the stream and highlighted.
	* Memory usage reduction (reduced in half).
	* 'Z' allows to specify view limits by center and amplitude.
	* Support for multiple graphs in a single instance.
	* Using '-' as a file name now causes stdin to be read.


Rev #54 28/04/2006 to Rev #58 03/10/2006
----------------------------------------

	* Graph filling can be enabled with 'f'.
	* 'd' now affects filling mode as well.
	* Messages are now removed also when paused.
	* Created a man page (trend.1).


Rev #49 05/12/2005 to Rev #54 28/04/2006
----------------------------------------

	* Changing zero now aligns the graph instead of the grid.
	* Fixed hung on negative 'grid-spec'.


Rev #44 23/07/2005 to Rev #49 05/12/2005
----------------------------------------

	* Console is no longer used for input, an embedded line editor is now
	  used (ie when setting limits/grid-spec interactively, stdin will
	  eventually be used for remote controlling).
	* Console is no longer used for output (except for fatal errors),
	  messages are now displayed on screen.
	* Zero can be set interactively with 'z'.
	* Dragging inside the distribution graph now shows the distribution
	  count for the selected value.


Rev #40 15/04/2005 to Rev #44 23/07/2005
----------------------------------------

	* Solaris build fixes.
	* Ported to OS X.


Rev #35 14/12/2004 to Rev #40 15/04/2005
----------------------------------------

	* Correctly align X grid lines in scrolling mode.
	* hist-spec now uses "x" instead of "*".
	* Support for direct binary input.
	* New example (see timeq) and cleanup.
	* DEPRECATES: N*M hist-specs should no longer be used, use NxM
	  instead. -i and -r flags should no longer be used, use -ci -cd.


Rev #27 02/11/2004 to Rev #35 14/12/2004
----------------------------------------

	* An "history specification" can be used on the command line as a
	  simplified alternative to the hist-sz/x-div pair.
	* Visual latency sampling/visualisation.
	* Differential input.
	* Grid enhancements/offsetting.


Rev #23 29/10/2004 to Rev #27 02/11/2004
----------------------------------------

	* Incorrectly initialised buffers could cause interactive
	  indicators to malfunction for first values.
	* Visualisation can be paused while still consuming data.
	* 'A' re-scales the graph without activating auto-scaling.


Rev #20 21/10/2004 to Rev #23 29/10/2004
----------------------------------------

	* Optimisations and huge internal latency reductions.
	* Fixed precision truncation in auto-scaling.
	* Fixed scrolling mode for "history" non multiple of "divisions".
	* Created a support/testing mailing list. See README for details.


Rev #15 27/09/2004 to Rev #20 21/10/2004
----------------------------------------

	* Implemented distribution graph.
	* Fixed trend for plain files.
	* Fixed parsing bug (unterminated buffer).
	* Fixed precision truncation in drawing code.


Rev #11 21/09/2004 to Rev #15 27/09/2004
----------------------------------------

	* Fixed standard X11/GLUT options (-display, -geometry, etc)
	* Implemented interactive indicators.


Rev #4 09/09/2004 to Rev #11 21/09/2004
---------------------------------------

	* Several optimisations. Code cleanup.
	* Colours are configurable.
	* All options have a command line flag now.
	* current/min/max values can be shown on the graph.
	* New shading mode.
	* Input can be an incremental counter.
	* Grid positioning was fixed.
	* The grid now disables itself when it's too dense to be drawn.
	* Auto-scaling can be toggled dynamically.
